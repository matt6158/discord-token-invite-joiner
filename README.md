# DISCONTINUED !!!
Maybe this will still work as it was made using selenium but this is no longer supported. I have a better version which uses requests but I have lost interest in discord automation so I probably won't make it public.

# discord token invite joiner
Joins a specified server on all the tokens in tokens.txt

# Usage
`python invite_joiner.py`

# Note
All your tokens must be located in a text file called `tokens.txt` which should be located in the same directory.
